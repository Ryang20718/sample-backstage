To solve for the three nearest points on a graph using code, you will need to write a program that does the following:

Accept a set of points as input, with each point represented as a pair of x and y coordinates.

Iterate over the set of points and calculate the distance between each pair of points using the Pythagorean theorem (or another suitable method).

Identify the three pairs of points with the smallest distances and store the coordinates of these points in a list or array.

Plot the coordinates of the three points on a graph and connect them with lines to form a triangle.

Here is an example of how this code might look in Python:
